						<p>What is Python??
							Python is a high-level object-oriented programming language that was created by Guido van
							Rossum. It is also called general-purpose programming language as it is used in almost every
							domain we can think of as mentioned below:
							This list can go on as we go but why python is so much popular let's see it in the next
							topic.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Web Development</li>
							<li>Software Development</li>
							<li>Game Development</li>
							<li>AI & ML</li>
							<li>Data Analytics</li>
						</ul>
						<p>You can learn each of this topics one by one. To master the Python you must also know how to
							write in HTML.</p>

						<h2>What is Python Programming?</h2>
					</header>
					<article>
						<p>You guys might have a question in mind that, why python? why not another programming
							language?

							So let me explain:

							Every Programming language serves some purpose or use-case according to a domain. for eg,
							Javascript is the most popular language amongst web developers as it gives the developer the
							power to handle applications via different frameworks like react, vue, angular which are
							used to
							build beautiful User Interfaces. Similarly, they have pros and cons at the same time. so if
							we
							consider python it is general-purpose which means it is widely used in every domain the
							reason
							is it's very simple to understand, scalable because of which the speed of development is so
							fast. Now you get the idea why besides learning python it doesn't require any programming
							background so that's why it's popular amongst developers as well. Python has simpler syntax
							similar to the English language and also the syntax allows developers to write programs with
							fewer lines of code. Since it is open-source there are many libraries available that make
							developers jobs easy ultimately results in high productivity. They can easily focus on
							business
							logic and Its demanding skills in the digital era where information is available in large
							data
							sets.

							IEEE spectrum list of top programming language 2021. The list of programming languages is
							based
							on popularity.

						<h2>Applications of Python Programming</h2>
					</header>
					<article>
						<p>
							<li> Web Development: Python offers different frameworks for web development like Django,
								Pyramid, Flask. This framework is known for security, flexibility, scalability.</li>

							<li> Game Development: PySoy and PyGame are two python libraries that are used for game
								development</li>

							<li> Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: There is a large number of open-source
								libraries which can be used while developing AI/ML applications.</li>

							<li> Desktop GUI: Desktop GUI offers many toolkits and frameworks using which we can build
								desktop applications.PyQt, PyGtk, PyGUI are some of the GUI frameworks.</li>

						<h2>Features of Python</h2>
					</header>
					<article>
						<p>Features of Python programming language

							<li>Readable: Python is a very readable language.</li>

							<li>Easy to Learn: Learning python is easy as this is a expressive and high level
								programming
								language, which means it is easy to understand the language and thus easy to learn.</li>

							<li>Cross platform: Python is available and can run on various operating systems such as
								Mac,
								Windows, Linux, Unix etc. This makes it a cross platform and portable language.</li>

							<li>Open Source: Python is a open source programming language.

							<li>Large standard library: Python comes with a large standard library that has some handy
								codes
								and functions which we can use while writing code in Python.</li>

							<li>Free: Python is free to download and use. This means you can download it for free and
								use it
								in your application. See: Open Source Python License. Python is an example of a FLOSS
								(Free/Libre Open Source Software), which means you can freely distribute copies of this
								software, read its source code and modify it.</li>

							<li>Supports exception handling: If you are new, you may wonder what is an exception? An
								exception is an event that can occur during program exception and can disrupt the normal
								flow of program. Python supports exception handling which means we can write less error
								prone code and can test various scenarios that can cause an exception later on.</li>

							<li> Advanced features: Supports generators and list comprehensions. We will cover these
								features later.</li>

							<li> Automatic memory management: Python supports automatic memory management which means
								the
								memory is cleared and freed automatically. You do not have to bother clearing the
								memory.
							</li>

						<h2>What Can You Do with Python?</h2>
					</header>
					<article>
						<p>
							You may be wondering what all are the applications of Python. There are so many applications
							of
							Python, here are some of the them.
							<li>Web development Web framework like Django and Flask are based on Python. They help you
								write server side code which helps you manage database, write backend programming logic,
								mapping urls etc.</li>

							<li>Machine learning There are many machine learning applications written in Python.
								Machine
								learning is a way to write a logic so that a machine can learn and solve a particular
								problem on its own. For example, products recommendation in websites like Amazon,
								Flipkart,
								eBay etc. is a machine learning algorithm that recognises user's interest. Face
								recognition
								and Voice recognition in your phone is another example of machine learning.</li>
							<li> Data Analysis Data analysis and data visualisation in form of charts can also be
								developed using Python.</li>

							<li>Scripting Scripting is writing small programs to automate simple tasks such as sending
								automated response emails etc. Such type of applications can also be written in Python
								programming language.</li>

							<li> Game development You can develop games using Python.</li>

							<li> You can develop Embedded applications in Python.</li>

							<li> Desktop applications You can develop desktop application in Python using library like
								TKinter or QT..</li>
